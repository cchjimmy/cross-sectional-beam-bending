# cross-sectional-beam-bending
This can analyse a user defined shape (with only rectangle primatives for now), and display information about the cross-section on screen.

See GitHub Pages for an example.

This can calculate:
+ Centroid
+ Second moment of area
+ Angle in radians between positive x axis and principal x axis
+ Second moment of area in principal axis

After the calculations are completed, illustrations will be drawn.
